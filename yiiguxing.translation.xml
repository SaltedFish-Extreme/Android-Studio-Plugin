      <item value="This trailing comma makes auto-formatting nicer for build methods." />
      <item value="Column is also a layout widget. It takes a list of children and arranges them vertically. By default, it sizes itself to fit its children horizontally, and tries to be as tall as its parent. Invoke &quot;debug painting&quot; (press &quot;p&quot; in the console, choose the &quot;Toggle Debug Paint&quot; action from the Flutter Inspector in Android Studio, or the &quot;Toggle Debug Paint&quot; command in Visual Studio Code) to see the wireframe for each widget. Column has various properties to control how it sizes itself and how it positions its children. Here we use mainAxisAlignment to center the children vertically; the main axis here is the vertical axis because Columns are vertical (the cross axis would be horizontal)." />
      <item value="Center is a layout widget. It takes a single child and positions it in the middle of the parent." />
      <item value="Here we take the value from the MyHomePage object that was created by the App.build method, and use it to set our appbar title." />
      <item value="This method is rerun every time setState is called, for instance as done by the _incrementCounter method above. The Flutter framework has been optimized to make rerunning build methods fast, so that you can just rebuild anything that needs updating rather than having to individually change instances of widgets." />
      <item value="This call to setState tells the Flutter framework that something has changed in this State, which causes it to rerun the build method below so that the display can reflect the updated values. If we changed _counter without calling setState(), then the build method would not be called again, and so nothing would appear to happen." />
      <item value="This widget is the home page of your application. It is stateful, meaning that it has a State object (defined below) that contains fields that affect how it looks. This class is the configuration for the state. It holds the values (in this case the title) provided by the parent (in this case the App widget) and used by the build method of the State. Fields in a Widget subclass are always marked &quot;final&quot;." />
      <item value="This is the theme of your application. Try running your application with &quot;flutter run&quot;. You'll see the application has a blue toolbar. Then, without quitting the app, try changing the primarySwatch below to Colors.green and then invoke &quot;hot reload&quot; (press &quot;r&quot; in the console where you ran &quot;flutter run&quot;, or simply save your changes to &quot;hot reload&quot; in a Flutter IDE). Notice that the counter didn't reset back to zero; the application is not restarted." />

      <item value="Set this if the view will serve as a scrolling container, meaning that it can be resized to shrink its overall window so that there will be space for an input method. If not set, the default value will be true if &quot;scrollbars&quot; has the vertical scrollbar set, else it will be false." />

      <item value="Accepts the given collector and emits values into it. This method can be used along with SAM-conversion of FlowCollector: myFlow.collect { value -&gt; println(&quot;Collected value&quot;) } Method inheritance To ensure the context preservation property, it is not recommended implementing this method directly. Instead, AbstractFlow can be used as the base type to properly ensure flow's properties. All default flow implementations ensure context preservation and exception transparency properties on a best-effort basis and throw IllegalStateException if a violation was detected." />

      <item value="I'm not in China: https:cirosantilli.comchina-dictatorshiphas-ciro-santilli-you-ever-lived-in-china I'm not 100% certain how important going through a third server is, this is beyond my domain of expertise. You obviously want encryption at all steps, i.e. HTTPS. And HTTPS alone already cannot be broken by anybody, the CCP won't be able to read the message. It all depends on how likely you think that a timing attack is: https:book.cyberyozh.comtiming-attack-how-special-services-deanonymize-users-messengers If you VPN into Tor however, a timing attack feels very unlikely given that each circuit will have a different timing. And please don't leak your ID through git log like terminus 2049 did: https:cirosantilli.comchina-dictatorshipterminus2049 !! So newb. I also recommend trying to contact the following peoplegroups: https:cirosantilli.comchina-dictatorshipduty-machine They seem to exclusively use a bot. https:github.comchinatimelinechinatimeline.github.io also bot related stuff. Perhaps just HTTPS and then using a bot through a private github repo is the best option. Research things thoroughly before doing anything. If you would like to publish or highlight a limited number of things, feel free to contact me privately on protonmail: https:cirosantilli.comcontact and I might publish it myself. Stay safe." />
